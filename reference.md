## S3DF Acknowledgement in Publications

Please acknowledge the role that the use of S3DF resources at SLAC had in your publications. We would also appreciate letting us know when your work is published or presented - this will allow us to highlight your work as well.

If your work uses resources that were made available as a result of explicit contributions from your project to S3DF, you may use the following suggested acknowledgement:

***"This work used the resources of the SLAC Shared Science Data Facility (S3DF) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, funded by `[Your Funding Source]` under contract `[your contract number]`. S3DF is a shared High-Performance Computing facility that supports the scientific and data-intensive computing needs of all experimental facilities and programs of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. SLAC is operated by Stanford University for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science."***

If your work used generally available resources on S3DF without explicit contributions to S3DF, you may use the following suggested acknowledgement:

***"This work used the resources of the SLAC Shared Science Data Facility (S3DF) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. S3DF is a shared High-Performance Computing facility, operated by SLAC, that supports the scientific and data-intensive computing needs of all experimental facilities and programs of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. SLAC is operated by Stanford University for the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science."***

We appreciate your cooperation in the acknowledgment and publication notifications. This will help the S3DF in communicating  the importance of its role in science to SLAC and our funding agencies and help assure the continued availability of this valuable resource.
