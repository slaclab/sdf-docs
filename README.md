Welcome to the SLAC Shared Scientific Data Facility (S3DF). The S3DF
is a compute, storage and network architecture designed to support
massive scale analytics required by all SLAC experimental facilities
and programs, including LCLS/LCLS-II, UED, cryo-EM, the accelerator,
and the Rubin observatory. The S3DF infrastructure is optimized for
data analytics and is characterized by large, massive throughput, high
concurrency storage systems.
