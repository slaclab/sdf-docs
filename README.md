# Welcome

Welcome to the SLAC Scientific Shared Data Facility (SDF). This site provides a web based frontend to all things related to high performance compuating (HPC) and storage at SLAC.

!> We're still beta testing SDF; if you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to [contact us](contact-us.md)!

## What is the SDF?

Science at SLAC is often powered by intensive numerical analysis of large datasets: the computation and storage needs for large scale science projects such as [x-ray crystallography](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu) and [CryoEM](https://cryoem.slac.stanford.edu) often requires petaflops of compute and petabytes of storage. The SDF serves to provide the hardware and software infrastructure in order to keep science ticking.

The SDF is comprised of many high powered compute servers interconnected with high speed networking fabrics. This in turn is connected to high performance storage. This, as well as the ecosystem that utilises all this power is what we call the SDF. 

SDF is owned and operated by SLAC's OCIO in partnership and in support of the SLAC research community.

## Why use SDF?

The SDF is tuned specifically to allow large and small compute and storage tasks. By storing your scientific datasets on the SDF, you will benefit from the economies of scale to help drive down the cost of data management. Through community sharing of compute resources you will be able to obtain compute cycles funded through indirects.

## How much does it cost?

All SLAC employees, researchers and facility users have free access to the SDF. Now, free does not necessarily mean capable. Every user, by default, is added to a [shared partition]() that you to immediately submit jobs onto the clusters. Each user is entitled to storage for both themselves and their 'groups' free of charge. Please see [Resources](resources.md) for up-to-date information.

If you find that you need more compute and or storage for your scientific needs, please see [contributing to SDF](stakeholders.md)
