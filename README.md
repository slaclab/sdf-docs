Welcome to the SLAC Shared Scientific Data Facility (S3DF). The S3DF
is a compute, storage and network architecture designed to support
massive scale analytics required by all SLAC experimental facilities
and programs, including LCLS/LCLS-II, UED, cryo-EM, the accelerator,
and the Rubin observatory. The S3DF infrastructure is optimized for
data analytics and is characterized by large, massive throughput, high
concurrency storage systems.

***S3DF Outage Update: Monday June 2nd 4:15pm PDT***

**The team has been able to recover the following systems:**

**SDFData (/sdf/data) filesystems**

**Kubernetes services (still checking DB integrity)**

**Ampere, ADA, and Milan compute clusters**

**The old SDFDirect S3 cluster is still recovering, but it is expected to be operational within a few hours.
The team is working on getting all computing nodes online.
Please let us know if you encounter any issues or have any questions.**
