Welcome to the SLAC Shared Scientific Data Facility (S3DF). The S3DF
is a compute, storage and network architecture designed to support
massive scale analytics required by all SLAC experimental facilities
and programs, including LCLS/LCLS-II, UED, cryo-EM, the accelerator,
and the Rubin observatory. The S3DF infrastructure is optimized for
data analytics and is characterized by large, massive throughput, high
concurrency storage systems.

***S3DF Outage scheduled for Monday July 7th from 4am to 8pm PDT***


**The Stanford Facilities team need to conduct an evaluation of the SRCF datacenter transformers. This work will require a full outage of all S3DF services.**
**More details will be posted on [our outage page](https://s3df.slac.stanford.edu/#/changelog?id=outages)**
