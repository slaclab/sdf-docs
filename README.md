Welcome to the SLAC Shared Scientific Data Facility (S3DF) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

S3DF is a compute, storage, and network architecture designed to support
massive scale analytics required by SLAC experimental facilities
and programs, including LCLS/LCLS-II, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, UED, and the Stanford-SLAC cryoEM Center (S2C2). S3DF provides platforms for deploying scientific applications, high performance compute nodes for large scale compute tasks, and a concurrent network filesystem and tape library for storing large volumes of data. S3DF aims to meet the increasing computing infrastructure resources that SLAC users and groups require to conduct their science experiments and analysis.
