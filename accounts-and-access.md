# Accounts and Access

## Getting a SLAC Account :id=access

If you are a SLAC employee, affiliated researcher, or experimental
facility user, you are eligible for an S3DF account.

?> S3DF authentication requires a SLAC Account (formerly known as a SLAC Windows account).

?> S3DF is currently in the process of deprecating the usage of SLAC UNIX accounts. Please obtain a SLAC Account prior to accessing S3DF.

If you need a SLAC Account, please follow the steps below. **If you already have an active SLAC Account, skip to [step 2](accounts-and-access.md#registers3df).**

1. Obtain a SLAC System ID (SID number).
  * SLAC employees should already have a SLAC System ID.
  * Affiliated users/experimental facility users should obtain a SLAC System ID via the Scientific Collaborative Researcher Registration [process form](https://it.slac.stanford.edu/identity/scientific-collaborative-researcher-registration).

2. Take the appropriate SLAC cybersecurity training course(s) via the [SLAC training portal](https://slactraining.slac.stanford.edu/how-access-the-web-training-portal):
  * All SLAC/Stanford employees or term employees of SLAC or the University: "CS200: Cyber Security Training for Employees".
  * All lab users and non-SLAC/Stanford employees: "CS100: Cyber Security for Laboratory Users Training".

  * Depending on your role, you may be required to take additional cybersecurity training. Consult with your supervisor or SLAC Point of Contact (POC) for more details.

3. Ask your [SLAC point of contact](contact-us.md#facpoc) to submit a ticket to SLAC IT requesting a SLAC Account on your behalf.

4. Once you have received a SLAC Account from SLAC IT, you must register it with S3DF. :id=registers3df

  * Log into the [Coact S3DF User Portal](https://coact.slac.stanford.edu) using your SLAC Account via the "SLAC Account" option.
  * Click on "Repos" in the menu bar.
  * Click the "Request Access to Facility" button and select the appropriate facility from the dropdown.
  * Include your affiliation and other contextual information for your request in the "Notes" field, then click submit.
  * A computing czar for the S3DF facility you requested access to will review your request. **Once approved by a facility czar**, your SLAC account registration should be completed within 1 hour.

?> Your S3DF facility computing czar may have already pre-registered your account in S3DF. Please log in to [Coact](https://coact.slac.stanford.edu) to activate your account.

## Managing your SLAC Account password

You can change your password via [the SLAC Account self-service password update site](https://adfs.slac.stanford.edu/adfs/portal/updatepassword).

If you have forgotten your password and need to reset it, [please contact the IT Service Desk](https://it.slac.stanford.edu/support).

Make sure you comply with all SLAC training and cybersecurity requirements to avoid having your account disabled. You will be notified of these requirements via email.
