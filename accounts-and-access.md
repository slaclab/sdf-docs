# Accounts

S3DF uses SLAC Account credentials for authentication and authorization. This SLAC Account must also be registered with S3DF. Once registered, you can then [access S3DF resources](access.md).

## Getting a SLAC Account :id=account

If you are a SLAC employee, affiliated researcher, or experimental facility user, you are eligible for an S3DF account.

1. Obtain a SLAC System ID (SID number):

  * SLAC employees should already have a SLAC System ID.

  * Affiliated users/experimental facility users should obtain a SLAC System ID via the Scientific Collaborative Researcher Registration [process form](https://it.slac.stanford.edu/identity/scientific-collaborative-researcher-registration).

2. Take the appropriate SLAC cybersecurity training course(s) via the [SLAC training portal](https://slactraining.slac.stanford.edu/how-access-the-web-training-portal):

  * All SLAC/Stanford employees or term employees of SLAC or the University: "CS200: Cyber Security Training for Employees".

  * All lab users and non-SLAC/Stanford employees: "CS100: Cyber Security for Laboratory Users Training".

  * Depending on your role, you may be required to take additional cybersecurity training. Consult with your supervisor or SLAC Point of Contact for more details.

3. Ask your [SLAC Point of Contact](contact-us.md#facpoc) to submit a ticket to SLAC IT requesting a SLAC Account on your behalf.
