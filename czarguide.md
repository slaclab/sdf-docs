# Beginner's Guide for Facility Czars

This guide is intended for facility czars to get started with managing their facility's repos, computing resources, user accounts, and more. The majority of czar tasks can be performed on [coact](https://coact.slac.stanford.edu) but this guide will cover some additional topics.

List of primary tasks for a facility czar:
* Create/manage repos for computing/storage resources for their facility
* Add/remove users to facility repos for accessing computing resources
* Add/remove users to Posix group for accessing storage resources (e.g. /sdf/data or /sdf/group)
* Inform facility users on how to access computing/storage resources on S3DF
* Commincate facility-wide issues or requests to S3DF admin team

> [!TIP]
> Facility czars play the role of an intermediary between S3DF general users and S3DF admin/support staff. Czars are the primary point-of-contact for users with S3DF issues/requests but not expected to provide full technical support; they can refer users to the [S3DF help Slack channel](slac.slack.com#comp-sdf).
