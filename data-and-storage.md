## Directory Structure

To promote long term consistency, the S3DF directory structure provides immutable paths, independent from the underlying file system organization and technology:

* `/sdf`: Root mount point.

* `/sdf/home/<u>/<username>`: Home directories.  Space & inode quotas imposed for all users.

* `/sdf/sw/<package>/<version>`: For general purpose software not installed on each node, e.g., EPICS, Matlab, matplotlib, GEANT4, etc.  Not meant for SW that is used by only one group.

* `/sdf/group/<organization>/<groupname>` or `/sdf/group/<groupname>`: For group/project specific software (e.g., lcls/psdm, ad/hla, etc.)

* `/sdf/data/<facility>/…`: For science data (as opposed to code, documents, etc), including raw, calibrated data, and results. Some examples:
  - LCLS experimental: `/sdf/data/lcls/<instrument>/<experiment>`
  - LCLS accelerator: `/sdf/data/lcls/accel/<bld|bsa|ca|...>`
  - FACET experimental: `/sdf/data/facet/<instrument>/<experiment>`
  - FACET accelerator: `/sdf/data/facet/accel/`
  - CryoEM: `/sdf/data/cryoem/<YYYYMM>/<experiment>`

* `/sdf/scratch/<facility>/…`: 3 months retention on a best effort basis (actual retention can be shorter or longer depending on actual usage)

## Directory Quotas

- User home directories are set with a 30 GB quota.  Quota and usage can be checked with
   - `df -h $HOME` or `df -h ~`

- Quota and usage of other directories can be checked with df -h as well.
   - Example:  `df -h /sdf/group/fermi`

- For quota questions and requests, please [Contact us](contact-us.md)


## Policies

- Home directories permissions will be delegated to each user. By default, home folders will be readable by everyone (you can change that by changing UNIX permissions on one or more of your folders) and everyone will be able to list `/sdf/home/<u>`.

- General purpose software will go under sw. Group specific software will go under `/sdf/group` and will be maintained by each group.

- Some groups may decide to logically hold all their information under `/sdf/group/<groupname>`. Such a structure may be implemented by each group via symlinks. The actual mount points and relative backup and archive policies will be based on the structure shown above. 


## Backup and Archiving

- Everything under `/sdf/{home, sw, group}` will be backed-up. The backup mechanism will be the same for all folders: snapshots will be taken at regular intervals (e.g., a few times a day) and will be accessible by the users through the file system itself, with no intervention from the system administrators. A subset of the snapshots will be copied to tape at a lower rate (e.g., once a day). Snaphosts for\
`/sdf/{home, sw, group}/<folder>`\
can be found at\
`/sdf/{home, sw, group}/.snapshots/<gmttime>/<folder>`

- Files/objects under `/sdf/data` will be archived according to a data retention policy defined by the facility. Facilities will be responsible for covering the media costs and overhead required by their policy. Derived data (results) may be backed up, or archived, or somewhere in between - TBD.

- The scratch spaces under `/sdf/scratch`  will not be backed up or archived. 

- A subset of users in each group will be able to access the command line interface to HPSS for the purpose of archiving/restoring to/from tape. Differently from backup, which will be automatically performed by the storage team within SCS, archiving will be the responsibility of each group (POC within SCS is OK).
