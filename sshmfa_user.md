# S3DF SSH with Multi-Factor Authentication

## SSH and Multi-Factor

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional layer of security for users and S3DF SSH logins. As a preliminary rollout, MFA has been configured on the `s3dflogin-mfa.slac.stanford.edu` bastion hosts. There are two methods to access S3DF via SSH - using a password and MFA challenge, or via SSH Keys with an out-of-band (not part of the SSH command)

?> The legacy SSH using SLAC Unix Computer accounts to `s3dflogin.slac.stanford.edu` will still be available as we introduce MFA-enabled SSH. Once all S3DF users have been migrated, we will deprecate all SLAC Unix SSH logon services.

## Passwords with MFA :id=passwords

?> If you do not already have Duo configured, please see SLAC's documentation [here](https://it.slac.stanford.edu/support/KB0010216)

1. When using password login, please use your SLAC Account (formerly "SLAC Windows account") credentials when connecting with SSH to `s3dflogin-mfa.slac.stanford.edu`.

2. You will be prompted for your SLAC Account password

3. After successfully entering your SLAC Account password, you will receive a Duo challenge. ![duo challenge prompt](assets/sshmfa_duo_challenge.png)

4. To complete the challenge, do one of:
  * Enter option `1` to send a notification to your Duo app
  * Enter option `2` to send an SMS message to your phone
  * Activate your registered security key (such as a Yubikey)


## SSH Keys with MFA :id=sshkeys

To use SSH key login, public keys must be registered with the S3DF key management system in order to be used with `s3dflogin-mfa.slac.stanford.edu` bastion hosts.

An SSH key can be used to log in as long as it is **valid**.
* A **valid** key has been refreshed in the last **25 hours**
  * A key can be refreshed any number of times
  * Refreshing a valid key resets the validity period

?> You may register as may keys as you like on as many computers as you like as long as each is registered with the S3DF SSH Key Service

### S3DF SSH Key Service

Log in to the [SSH key management service](https://s3df-sshkeys.slac.stanford.edu) in a web browser. You will be required to log in using an MFA method.

You will arrive at a welcome page with two options: to `Register Public Key` or `List Public Keys`.

#### Registering a New SSH Key

To add a public key, click the `Register Public Key` button. You will be taken to the SSH key registration page:  
![SSH key registration page](assets/sshmfa_upload_page.png)

Ensure the username in large type at the top of the page is the name of the account you want to manage.

For your convenience, there is a code block in the middle of the page you may copy and paste into your terminal.
It does several things on your computer for you:
* A subdirectory for S3DF keys is created as `.ssh/s3df` in your home directory
* A new, secure SSH key pair is generated. You may add a passphrase to the key if you wish
* A configuration line is added to your `.ssh/config` file to associate the new SSH key with S3DF bastion hosts
* The public key is printed on the terminal in SSH2 format

Whether you used the copied code or created a key pair yourself, copy the text of the **SSH2-formatted public key**. At the bottom of the page is a box for you to paste the SSH2-formatted public key. Paste it there and press the "Submit" button.  
![SSH upload box](assets/sshmfa_upload_box.png)

SSH2 format looks like this:
```
---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
Comment: "256-bit ED25519, converted by user@hosstname"
AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJEVMB7OgUzz6cfWJmgKfmsGG2/M82MEG7/r6r1SmjVY
---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
```
The SSH2 formatted key can be retrieve from the key file by running `ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/s3df/<name of key>`

#### Managing and Refreshing Keys

A key remains valid for 25 hours after which time it must be refreshed.
To refresh a key, visit the [SSH key management service](https://s3df-sshkeys.slac.stanford.edu) and click the "List Public Keys" button.

You will be shown a list of your registered keys. If the list is empty, you may need to register a key as described [above](#registering-a-new-ssh-key).
To refresh a key's 7-day validity period, click the "Refresh" button to the right of that key.

If you wish to make a key invalid before the validity period would otherwise end, click the "Inactivate" button next to that key.

SSH keys are identified by their fingerprints. A key's fingerprint can be retrieved from the public key by running `ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/s3df/<name of key>`
