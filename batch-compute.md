# Batch Compute

Slurm is a batch scheduler that enables users (you!) to submit long (or even short) compute 'jobs' to our compute clusters. It will queue up jobs such that the (limited) resources compute resources available are fairly shared and distributed for all users. This page describes basic usage of slurm at SLAC. It will provide some simple examples of how to request common resources.

## Why should I use Batch?

Whilst your desktop computer and or laptop computer has a fast processor and quick local access to data stored on its hard disk/ssd; you may want to run either very big and/or very large compute tasks that may require a lot of CPUs, GPUs, memory, or a lot of data. Our compute servers that are part of the Batch system allows your to do this. Our servers typically also have very fast access to centralised storage, have (some) common software already preinstalled, and will enable you to run these long tasks without impacting your local desktop/laptop resources.

## Why should I use Slurm?

Historically, we have always use IBM's LSF as our Batch scheduler software. However, with new hardware such as GPU's, we have found that the user experience and the administrative accounting features of LSF to be lacking. Slurm is also commonly used across academic and laboratory environments and we hope that this commonality will facilitate easy usage for you, and simpler administration for us.


## What should I know about using Batch?

As the number of servers and GPUs in our environment is limited (but not small), we need to keep account of who uses what. In addition, as groups/teams can purchase their own servers to be added to the SDF we must provide a method of which allocated users can have priority access to the servers that were purchased for them. A slurm Account is basically something that you will charge your job against.


## What is a Slurm Partition?

A Partition is a logical grouping of compute servers. These may be servers of a similar technical specification (eg Cascade Lake CPUs, Telsa GPUs etc), or by ownership of the servers - eg SUNCAT group may have purchased so many servers, so we put them all into a Partition.

Generally, all servers will be placed in the shared partition that everyone with a slac computer account will have access to (although at a low priority).

Users should contact their Coordinators to be added to appropriate group Partitions to get priority access to resources.

You can view the active Partitions on SDF with

```
$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
shared*      up 7-00:00:00     21   unk* cryoem-gpu[02,04-09,11-15],ml-gpu[02-10]
shared*      up 7-00:00:00     10   idle cryoem-gpu[01,03,10,50],hep-gpu01,ml-gpu[01,11],nu-gpu[01-03]
ml           up   infinite      9   unk* ml-gpu[02-10]
ml           up   infinite      2   idle ml-gpu[01,11]
neutrino     up   infinite      3   idle nu-gpu[01-03]
cryoem       up   infinite     12   unk* cryoem-gpu[02,04-09,11-15]
cryoem       up   infinite      4   idle cryoem-gpu[01,03,10,50]
```


## What is a Slurm Allocation?

In order to provide appropriate access for users to the hardware, an Allocation is created that defines what User can run on what Partition and charge against what Account (there's a bit more in the backend to this).


## How do I use Slurm?

Common commands are:

srun	request a quick job to be ran - eg an interactive terminal
sbatch	submit a batch job to run
squeue	show jobs
scancel	cancel a job
scontrol show job	show job details
sstat	show job usage details
sacctmgr	manage Associations
 


## How can I get an Interactive Terminal?


use the srun command


```
srun -A shared -p shared -n 1 --pty /bin/bash
```

This will then execute /bin/bash on a (scheduled) server in the Partition shared and charge against Account shared. This will request a single CPU, launch a pseudo terminal (pty) where bash will run. You may be provided different Accounts and Partitions and should use them when possible.

Note that when you 'exit' the interactive session, it will relinquish the resources for someone else to use. This also means that if your terminal is disconnected (you turn your laptop off, loose network etc), then the Job will also terminate (similar to ssh).



## How do I submit a Batch Job?

use the sbatch command, this primer needs to be elaborated:

Create a job submission script (text file) script.sh:

```
#!/bin/bash
 
#SBATCH --account=shared
#SBATCH --partition=shared
#SBATCH --qos=scavenger
#
#SBATCH --job-name=test
#SBATCH --output=output-%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=output-%j.txt
#
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=12
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1g
#
#SBATCH --time=10:00
#
#SBATCH --gpus 1
 
<commands here>

```

In the above example, we submit a job named 'test' and output both stdout and stderr to the same file (%j will be replaced with the Job ID). We request a single Task (think of it as an MPI rank) and that single task will request 12 CPUs; each of which will be allocated 1GB of RAM - so a total of 12GB. By default, the --ntasks will be equivalent to the number of nodes (servers) asked for. In order to aid scheduling (and potentially prioritising the Job), we limit the length of the Job to 10 minutes.

We also request a single GPU with the Job. This will be exposed via CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES. To specify specific GPU's, see below.

You will need an account (see below). All SLAC users have access to the "shared" partition with a quality of service of "scavenger". This is so that stakeholders of machines in the SDF will get priority access to their resources, whilst any user can use all resources as long as the 'owners' of the hardware isn't wanting to use it. As such, owners (or stakeholders) will have qos "normal" access to their partitions (of which such hosts are also within the shared partition).

Then, in order to submit the job: 

```
sbatch script.sh 
```

You can then use the command to monitor your job progress

```
squeue
```

And you can cancel the job with

```
scancel <jobid>
```

##  How can I request GPUs?
You can use the --gpus to specify gpus for your jobs: Using a number will request the number of any gpu that is available (what you get depends upon what your Account/Association is and what is available when you request it). You can also specify the type of gpus by prefixing the number with the model name. eg

```
# request single gpu
srun -A shared -p shared -n 1 --gpus 1 --pty /bin/bash
 
# request a gtx 1080 gpu
srun -A shared -p shared -n 1 --gpus geforce_gtx_1080_ti:1 --pty /bin/bash
 
# request a gtx 2080 gpu
srun -A shared -p shared -n 1 --gpus geforce_rtx_2080_ti:1 --pty /bin/bash
 
# request a v100 gpu
srun -A shared -p shared -n 1 --gpus v100:1 --pty /bin/bash
```

## How can I see what GPUs are available?

```
# sinfo -o "%12P %5D %14F %7z %7m %10d %11l %42G %38N %f"

## How can I request a GPU with certain features and or memory?

TBA... something about using Constraints. Maybe get the gres for gpu memory working.

## What Accounts are there?

Accounts are used to allow us to track, monitor and report on usage of SDF resources. As such, users who are members of stakeholders of SDF hardware, should use their relevant Account to charge their jobs against. We do not associate any monetary value to Accounts currently, but we do require all Jobs to be charged against an Account.

## What Partitions are there?
Partitions define a grouping of machines. In our use case the grouping to refer to science and engineering groups who have purchased servers for the SDF. We do this such that members (or associates) of those groups can have priority access to their hardware. Whilst we give everyone access to all hardware, by default, users who belong to groups who do not own any stake in SDF will have lower priority access and use of stakeholder's resources.

## Help! My Job takes a long time before it starts!

This is often due to limited resources. The simplest way is to request less CPU (-N) or less memory for your Job. However, this will also likely increase the amount of time that you need for the Job to complete. Note that perfect scaling is often very difficult (ie using 16 CPUs will run twice as fast as 8 CPUs), so it may be beneficial to submit many smaller Jobs where possible. You can also set the --time option to specify that your job will only run upto that amount of time so that the scheduler can better fit your job in.

The more expensive option is to buy more hardware to SDF and have it added to your group/teams Partition.

You can also make use of the Scavenger QoS such that your job may run on any available resources available at SLAC. This, however, has the disadvantage that should the owners of the hardware that your job runs on requires its resources, your may will be terminated (preempted) - possibly before it has completed.



## What is QoS?

A Quality of Service for a job defines restrictions on how a job is ran. In relation to an Allocation, a user may preempt, or be preempted by other job with a 'higher' QoS. We define 2 levels of QoS:

scavenger: Everyone has access to all resources, however it is ran with the lowest priority and will be terminated if another job with a higher priority needs it

normal: Standard QoS for owners of hardware; jobs will (attempt) to run til completion and will not be preempted. normal jobs therefore will preempt scavenger jobs.

Scavenger QoS is useful if you have jobs that may be resumed (checkpointed) and if there are available resources available (ie owners are not using all of their resources).

You may submit to multiple Partition with the same QoS level:


```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=cryoem
#SBATCH --partition=cryoem,shared
#SBATCH --qos=scavenger
```

In the above example, a cryoem user is charging against their Account cryoem; she is willing to run the job whereever available (the use of the cryoem Partition is kinda moot as the cryoem nodes are a subset of the Shared Partition anyway).

is it possible to define multiple? ie cryoem with normal + shared with scavenger?



## How can I restrict/contraint which servers to run my Job on?

You can use slurm Constraints. We tag each and every server that help identify specific Features that each has: whether that is the kind of CPU, or the kind of GPU that run on them.

You can view a servers specific Feature's using


```
