# Accounts

S3DF uses SLAC Account credentials for authentication and authorization. This SLAC Account must also be registered with S3DF. Once registered, you can then [access S3DF resources](access.md).

## Current S3DF Users: Getting a SLAC Account

If you are currently using S3DF with a deprecated Unix account, please use this [self-service application to create your SLAC Account](https://ad-account.slac.stanford.edu).
If the application reports you already have an existing SLAC Account, contact the [SLAC IT Service Desk](https://it.slac.stanford.edu/support) and request re-enablement or password reset.

## New S3DF Users: Getting a SLAC Account

If you are a SLAC employee, affiliated researcher, or experimental facility user, you are eligible for an S3DF account.

1. Obtain a **SLAC System ID** (SID number):

  * SLAC employees should already have a SLAC System ID.

  * Affiliated users/experimental facility users should obtain a SLAC System ID via the Scientific Collaborative Researcher Registration [process form](https://it.slac.stanford.edu/identity/scientific-collaborative-researcher-registration).

2. Take the appropriate SLAC **cyber-security training course(s)** via the [SLAC training portal](https://slactraining.slac.stanford.edu/how-access-the-web-training-portal):

  * All SLAC/Stanford employees or term employees of SLAC or the University: "CS200: Cyber Security Training for Employees".

  * All lab users and non-SLAC/Stanford employees: "CS100: Cyber Security for Laboratory Users Training".

  * Depending on your role, you may be required to take additional cybersecurity training. Consult with your supervisor or SLAC Point of Contact for more details.

3. Ask your [SLAC Point of Contact](contact-us.md#facpoc) to submit a ticket to SLAC IT requesting a SLAC Account on your behalf.

4. Once you have received a SLAC Account from SLAC IT, you must **register with S3DF**:

  a) Log into the [Coact User Portal (https://coact.slac.stanford.edu)](https://coact.slac.stanford.edu) using your SLAC Account via the "SLAC Account" option.  

  b) Click on "Repos" in the menu bar.  

  c) Click the "Request Access to Facility" button and select your appropriate facility affliation from the dropdown.  

  d) Include your affiliation and other contextual information for your request in the "Notes" field, then click submit.  

  e) A computing Czar for the S3DF Facility you requested access to will review your request. **Once approved by a facility czar**, you shall receive an email of successful registration.

?> Your S3DF facility computing czar may have already pre-registered your account in S3DF so that the above step of Requesting access to a Facility in Coact is not necessary. In such cases, you will instead receive an email asking for you to log in to https://coact.slac.stanford.edu to activate your account.


## Managing your SLAC Account :id=managing-account

Please ensure that you comply with all SLAC training and cyber-security requirements to avoid having your account disabled. You will be notified of these requirements via email.

If you have forgotten your password and need to reset it, please contact the [SLAC IT Service Desk](https://it.slac.stanford.edu/support).
